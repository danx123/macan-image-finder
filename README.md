# macan-image-finder
Macan Image Finder is a desktop application built with Python and PySide6 that enables content-based image retrieval (CBIR). It allows users to search for similar images within their indexed local directories using an image as a query, relying on robust computer vision techniques (ORB feature detection, feature matching, and homography estimation)
